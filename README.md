# Identifying The Presence of Heart Disease Using Different Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

In this modern era everyone wants to live a healthy life. But there is some disease which control people life and nobody can ignore these types of disease. Heart disease is one of them. If anyone can know what is going through in their heart, is it in danger or is it on a safe zone then it will help people to tackling the disease. It is really important to know about our hearts and keep it safe from disease cause heart disease can hamper any life for lifetime. Heart disease is a longtime disease and itâ€™s really hard to prevent it because we live in a populated world. This paper is about detecting heart disease in a patient depends on some attribute, which is from some test. We tried different types of machine learning tools and we achieved more than 90% success to detect the heart disease.
